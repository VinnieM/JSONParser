An entire JSON Object is traversed and the required JSON object or array (no matter the depth) is searched, and the result is given out as a Java Object. The proposed solution takes in a JSON input, and produces an output(Java Object). The input would be as a JSON Object, searches for the nodes specified, and gives out the result as a Java Object as the output.
